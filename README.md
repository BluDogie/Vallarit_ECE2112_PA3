# Vallarit, Marick Andrei T. 2ECE-C
Experiment 3 - Python Data Analysis

# I. Intended Learning Outcomes:
1. To identify the codes and functions incorporated in the Pandas library
2. To be able to apply and use the different codes and functions in creating a Python program using a
Pandas library
# II. Instructions:
Write a Python script/code in the Jupyter Notebook to do the given problems. You may submit your Jupyter
notebook in the dedicated submission bin.
For this programming assignment, download the following file and save to your default user folder:
http://bit.ly/Cars_file

#### PROBLEM 1: Save your file as Surname_Pandas-P1.py
Using knowledge obtained from the experiment and demonstrations:
##### a. Load the corresponding .csv file into a data frame named cars using pandas
##### b. Display the first five and last five rows of the resulting cars.

#### Output:

*I saved the file as .py in Microsoft Visual Code*

#### PROBLEM 2: Save your file as Surname_Pandas-P2.py
Using the dataframe cars in problem 1, extract the following information using subsetting, slicing and
indexing operations.
##### a. Display the first five rows with odd-numbered columns (columns 1, 3, 5, 7...) of cars.
##### b. Display the row that contains the ‘Model’ of ‘Mazda RX4’.
##### c. How many cylinders (‘cyl’) does the car model ‘Camaro Z28’ have?
##### d. Determine how many cylinders (‘cyl’) and what gear type (‘gear’) do the car models ‘Mazda RX4 Wag’, ‘Ford Pantera L’ and ‘Honda Civic’ have.

#### Outputs:

a. Display the first five rows with odd-numbered columns (columns 1, 3, 5, 7...) of cars.

d. Determine how many cylinders (‘cyl’) and what gear type (‘gear’) do the car models ‘Mazda RX4 Wag’, ‘Ford Pantera L’ and ‘Honda Civic’ have.

*I used different cells in Jupyter Notebook in order to check if my output was correct. I saved the file as .py in Microsoft Visual Code*

# Personal Challenges from this Experiment
For the overall problems, I got confused about how to save the files as .py since when saving the files as .py (File >> Save Notebook As >>), the whole notebook will get saved. For a solution, I used Microsoft Visual Code to save the individual problems, Hence,
the two .py files in the repository.

For problem 1, I had no challenges since all I needed to do was to display the first 5 and last 5 rows of the cars.csv file.

For problem 2, I was confused a couple of times. Specifically, in letter A, wherein I had to display the first five rows with odd-numbered columns of cars, I had trouble formulating a logic for this since I got confused about whether I needed to print the odd-numbered rows of cars, or whether I needed to only print the rows that have odd-numbered columns. For the rest of the letters, it was fairly simple.
